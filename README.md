# THIS IS NOT FINISHED

TODO:
- [ ] Write all the utility code to handle generic applications

      **NOTE:** Mostly(?) done
- [ ] Write all the utility code to handle Discord in the best way possible

      **NOTES:** We have to try and mess with the Discord installation folder, rather than the modules folder
- [ ] Write a thing that will detect the Electron version so we can avoid injecting where we know Glasscord won't ever work
- [ ] Write another thing that will allow us to blacklist certain applications
- [ ] Write the actual user interface and routines to patch applications
- [ ] Write the packaging rules so we can package the installer and ship it
- [ ] Write the PKGBUILD for AUR since the Arch guys always have it easy as frick
